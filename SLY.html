<h1>SLYLETHERIN...</h1>

<p><font face="algerian">
<h2>Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,<img src="slytherin.gif"> <br>founded by Salazar Slytherin.In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued.Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition.<br> Many Slytherin students tended to clique together, often acquiring leaders, <br>which further exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and the Death Eaters.<br>

The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it could be a factor when being sorted.[1][17] Students of any blood status could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite rare.
