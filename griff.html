<p><font face="algerian"><h3> <br>Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric <img src="gryffindor.gif">Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, and determination,[4] to be sorted into his house. The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold.[2] Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House ghost.

Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house.[2] The colour of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat. </h3></font></p>
